### Download

You can download the latest version of the Warlight2 Engine here: [warlight2-engine-1.0.0.jar](https://github.com/theaigames/warlight2-engine/releases/download/v1.0.0/warlight2-engine-1.0.0.jar). Find the all downloads (including older versions) on the [release page](https://github.com/theaigames/warlight2-engine/releases).

#### Running the jar

The downloaded `.jar` file is easily run on any OS with the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) installed with the following:

```
java -jar warlight2-engine-1.0.0.jar [map file] [your bot1] [your bot2] 2>err.txt 1>out.txt
```

-	`[map file]` is a file that contains a string representation of the map that the game will use. An example is included in this repository called `example-map.txt`. For other maps, go to any Warlight AI Challenge 2 game on theaigames.com and add `/map` to the end of the URL and copy that text to a file.
-	`[your bot1]` and `[your bot2]` could be any command for running a bot process. For instance `java -cp /home/dev/starterbot/bin/ main.BotStarter` or `node /home/user/bot/Bot.js`

Errors will be logged to `err.txt`, output dump will be logged to `out.txt`.
